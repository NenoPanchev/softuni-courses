Attention Please!

Testing


Testing is an important part of the application lifecycle

In our ever-changing environment, testing is a necessity

New features need to be verified, before delivered to the clients

Testing

5


Testing is a wide area of application development

There are several levels of testing

It does not affect only programmers

It has many concepts of development

There are different types of testing

Testing (2)

6


Unit Testing


Unit Testing

A level of software testing where individual components 
are tested

The purpose is to validate that each unit performs 
as designed

The lowest level of software testing

Often isolated in order to ensure individual testing

Unit Testing

8


Software practice, primarily used in Unit Testing

An object under test may have dependencies on other objects

To isolate the behavior, the other objects are replaced

The replacements are mocked objects

The mocked objects simulate the behavior of the real objects

Mocking

9


Unit testing increases confidence in 
changing / maintaining code

Development is faster:

Verifying the correctness of new functionality is not manual

Localizing bugs, introduced in development is much faster

The code is modular and reusable (necessary for Unit testing)



Benefits

10


Simple Demonstration

Unit Testing a Web Application


Unit Testing for web apps is similar to the unit tests we've done

Writing test methods to test classes and methods (functionalities)

Testing individual code components (units) 

Independently from the infrastructure

You still use the same testing frameworks as in casual unit testing

Unit Testing

12


When using a web frameworks such as Spring MVC

Built-in logic does not need to be tested

It is already tested during the development of the framework itself

You still need to test your custom functionality

Unit Testing

13


Testing a simple service with mocking in an Spring MVC app

Unit Testing

@Entity

@Table(name = "users")

public class User {

    private String id;

    private String username;

    private String password;

    

    ...

}

@Repository

public interface UserRepository 
extends JpaRepository<User, String> {

    User findByUsername(String username);

}

public interface UserService {

    User getUserByUsername(String username);

}

@Service

public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {

    ...

    public User getUserByUsername(String username) {
        return this.userRepository.findByUsername(username);

    }

}

14


Testing a simple service with mocking in an Spring MVC app

Unit Testing

public class UserServiceTests {

    private User testUser;

    private UserRepository mockedUserRepository;

    

    @Before

    public void init() {

        this.testUser = new User() {{ 

            setId("SOME_UUID"); 

            setUsername("Pesho"); 

            setPassword("123"); 

        }};

        

        this.mockedUserRepository = Mockito.mock(UserRepository.class);

    }}

15


Testing a simple service with mocking in an Spring MVC app

Unit Testing (Arrange)

public class UserServiceTests {

    @Test

    public void userService_GetUserWithCorrectUsername_ShouldReturnCorrect() {

        // Arrange

        Mockito.when(this.mockedUserRepository

                .findByUsername("Pesho"))

                .thenReturn(this.testUser);        

        

        UserService userService = new

                     UserServiceImpl(this.mockedUserRepository);

        User expected = this.testUser;

    }}

16


Testing a simple service with mocking in an Spring MVC app

Unit Testing (Act)

public class UserServiceTests {

    @Test

    public void

         userService_GetUserWithCorrectUsername_ShouldReturnCorrect() {

        ...

        

        // Act

        User actual = userService.getUserByUsername("Pesho");

        

        ...

    }

}

17


Testing a simple service with mocking in an Spring MVC app

Unit Testing (Assert)

public class UserServiceTests {

    @Test

    public void

        userService_GetUserWithCorrectUsername_ShouldReturnCorrect() {

        ...

        // Assert

        Assert.assertEquals("Broken...", expected.getId(),

								actual.getId());

        Assert.assertEquals("Broken...", expected.getUsername(),

								actual.getUsername());

        Assert.assertEquals("Broken...", expected.getPassword(),

								actual.getPassword());

    }}

18


Web applications also need testing for:

Controllers

Services

Custom Components etc.

Testing

19


20

Different components of the application are tested differently

They are tested on different levels

Unit testing

Integration testing

End-to-End testing

Every component of the application must be tested

Testing


Testing the Web Layer


UserController example

Testing Controller

@Controller

@RequestMapping("/users")

public class UserController {

	// Inject UserService in constructor

    @GetMapping("/{id}")

    public ModelAndView getById(@PathVariable("id") Long id, ModelAndView modelAndView) {

        modelAndView.addObject("user", this.userService.findById(id));

        modelAndView.setViewName("one");

        return modelAndView;

    }

    @GetMapping("/all")

    public ModelAndView findAll(ModelAndView modelAndView){

        modelAndView.addObject("users", this.userService.findAll());

        modelAndView.setViewName("all");

        return modelAndView;

    }

}

22

25

Simple test examples 

@SpringBootTest

@AutoConfigureMockMvc

public class UserControllerTests {

    @Autowired

    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Test

    public void when_getOneStudents_returnFirst() throws Exception {

        mockMvc

                .perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders

                        .get("/users/1"))

                .andExpect(status().isOk())

                .andExpect(view().name("one"))

                .andExpect(model().attributeExists("user"));

}


26

Simple test examples (2) 

@SpringBootTest

@AutoConfigureMockMvc

public class AuthorsControllerTest {

	// @Autowired MockMvc and AuthorRepository 

  @BeforeEach

  public void setUp() { // Add two test authors in repository }

  @AfterEach

  public void tearDown() { authorRepository.deleteAll(); }

  @Test

  public void testGetAuthorsCorrect() throws Exception {

    this.mockMvc.perform(get("/authors")).

        andExpect(status().isOk()).

        andExpect(jsonPath("$", hasSize(2))).

        andExpect(jsonPath("$.[0].name", is(author1Name))).

        andExpect(jsonPath("$.[1].name", is(author2Name)));  }


27

Testing with MockUser 







Specific Roles



Simple test examples (3)

@Test

@WithMockUser("customUsername")

public void getMessageWithMockUserCustomUsername() {

	String message = messageService.getMessage();

...

}

@Test

@WithMockUser(username="admin",roles={"USER","ADMIN"})

public void getMessageWithMockUserCustomUser() {

	String message = messageService.getMessage();

	...

}


28

When testing saving in db methods, we can 
use Embedded database.

Just adding @AutoConfigureTestDatabase

Simple test examples (4)

@SpringBootTest

@AutoConfigureMockMvc

@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(connection = EmbeddedDatabaseConnection.H2)

public class UserControllerTests { 

	// Tests

}


There are also different concepts and practices of test development

Code-first approach (The usual Development)

Test-first approach (Test-Driven Development)

Testing

29


Each has its own advantages and disadvantages

The Code-first approach ensures flexibility & fast development

The Code-first approach requires additional refactoring

The Test-first approach ensures quality and edge case coverage

The Test-first approach is complicated and is an "initial delay"

Testing (2)

Some of the most common levels of Software Testing

Common levels of Software Testing

Testing Level

Description

Unit Testing

Tests Individual components of code, independent from the infrastructure

Component Testing

Testing of multiple functionalities (a single component)

Integration Testing

Testing of all integrated modules to verify the combined functionality

System Testing

Tests the system as a whole, once all the components are integrated

31


Common levels of Software Testing (2)

Testing Level

Description

Regression Testing

Testing that recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features.

Acceptance Testing

Tests if the product meets the client's requirements. Purely done by QAs

Load / Stress Testing

Test the application's limits by attempting large data processing and 
introducting abnormal circumstances and conditions (edge cases)

Security Testing

Test if the application has any security flaws and vulnerabilities

Other Types of Testing

Manual, automation, UI, performance, black box, end-to-end testing, etc.

32


Unit testing ensures the correctness of a particular unit

Not testing all components may lead to false results

A single unit may function correctly, independent of the infrastructure

Combining components and testing them collectively is necessary

Every level of testing is essential to an application’s lifecycle

Testing

33


Different Testing levels require different time and resources

Different Testing levels



Components Tests

* Developers

Integration Tests

API Tests

* Developers & / QA

Functional Tests (GUI)

* Developers & / QA

Unit Tests
