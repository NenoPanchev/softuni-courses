What Are the Events


Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern

Provides one object with a loosely couple method of 
informing multiple objects of property changes

The core of Spring is the ApplicationContext, which 
manages the complete life cycle of the beans

The ApplicationContext publishes certain types of 
events when loading the beans

Spring's event handling is single-threaded so if an event is published, until all the receivers get the message, the processes are blocked and the flow will not continue

Events in Spring

6


ContextRefreshedEvent	

published when the ApplicationContext is either initialized/refreshed

ContextStartedEvent

published when the ApplicationContext is started 
using the start()

ContextStoppedEvent

published when the ApplicationContext is stopped 
using the stop()

Spring Build-in Events

7


ContextClosedEvent

published when the ApplicationContext is closed using 
the close()

RequestHandledEvent

Web-specific event telling all beans that an HTTP 
request has been serviced



Spring Build-in Events (2)

Listening for Events


There are ways to listens for events in Spring:

Implement the ApplicationListener interface 

Which has just one method onApplicationEvent()

Use @EventListener()

Annotate on a method 

Some of the events is published too early for a listener to be found via annotations and the application context. Then you must register them in Spring Application or use Factory





Listening for Events

10


Implementing ApplicationListener interface	

Using ApplicationListeners Example

11

@Component
public class EventsListener implements ApplicationListener<SpringApplicationEvent> {
    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(SpringApplicationEvent e) {
        System.out.printf("Event-%s!%n",     		  		e.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }}


Use @EventListener() with specific event class

Using @EventListener

12

@EventListener(ApplicationStartingEvent.class)

public void startEvent(){

	System.out.println("Starting Event!"); }



@EventListener(RequestHandledEvent.class)

public void requestHandler(){

	System.out.println("Request Handler event!");

}


Use @EventListener(classes = {EventOne.class, EventTwo.class}) to listen for multiple events

Listening for Multiple Events

13

@EventListener(classes = {MyEventOne.class, MyEventTwo.class})
public void handleTwoEvents(){

	System.out.println("Listens for two events!");

}


Using lambda expressions with specific event class

Using Lambda When Adding Listener

14

@SpringBootApplication

public class DemoForCustomEventsApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        SpringApplication springApp = new SpringApplication

			(DemoForCustomEventsApplication.class);

        springApp.addListeners((ApplicationContextInitializedEvent e) -> { 		System.out.println("App context init event"); });

	springApp.run(args); 

    }

}


15

Remember that for some event is published too 
early for a listener to be found and needs 
to be added

Register Events in Spring Application 



@SpringBootApplication

...

   springApp.addListeners(new MyEventsClass());

   springApp.run(args);

...


The listener of an event to a phase of the transaction

Transaction phases :

AFTER_COMMIT - The default, used to fire the event if the 
transaction has completed successfully 

AFTER_ROLLBACK - when transaction has rolled back

AFTER_COMPLETION - when transaction has completed 

BEFORE_COMMIT -  used to fire the event right before 
transaction commit

Transaction Bound Events

16


An example of Transaction Bound Event, that will fire before transaction commit 

Transaction Bound Events (2)

17

@TransactionalEventListener(phase = TransactionPhase.BEFORE_COMMIT)

public void transactionEventListener

			(MyCustomEvent event){

    System.out.println("Hit before transaction commit!");

}


Creating Custom Event

Event


To create and publish our custom event, there is some steps 
that we need to follow:

Create our custom event class that extends 
ApplicationEvent interface

Create publisher, that publish our new event

Add event listener, that listens for our new event

Creating Custom Event

19


20

Create our event class, that implements ApplicationEvent

Create Our Custom Event Class

public class MyCustomEvent extends ApplicationEvent {

    private String msg;

    public MyCustomEvent(Object source, String msg) {

        super(source);

        this.msg = msg;

    }

	... }


Create a publisher that publish our custom event and inject 
in him the ApplicationEventPublisher object

21

@Component

public class MyPublisher {

    @Autowired // It is better to inject in constructor 

    private ApplicationEventPublisher appEventPublisher;

    public void publishEvent(String message) {

        MyCustomEvent myEvent = new MyCustomEvent(this, message);

        appEventPublisher.publishEvent(myCustomEvent);

    } } ;

Create Publisher


Create listeners, already explain the different ways

22

@Component

public class Listeners {

    @EventListener(MyCustomEvent.class)

    public void listener(MyCustomEvent myCustomEvent) {

        System.out.printf("Custom event listeners with message 				-%s!%n", myCustomEvent.getMsg());

    }

}

Create Listener


Scheduling Tasks


Scheduling is a process of executing the tasks for 
the specific time period

Spring Boot provides a good support to write a 
scheduler on the Spring applications

We can specified the time period by different ways:

Using Cron

Using Fixed Rate

Using Fixed Delay

Scheduling Tasks

24


Java Cron expressions are used to configure the 
instances of CronTrigger

The cron expression consists of six fields:

     	<second><minute><hour><day-of-month><month><day-of-week>

Scheduled Task Using Cron

@Scheduled(cron = "0 5 * * * ?")

public void showTimeWithCron(){

        System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now());

}

25


Fixed Rate scheduler is used to execute the tasks at 
the specific time

It does not wait for the completion of previous task

The values should be in milliseconds

Scheduled Task Using Fixed Rate

@Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000)

    public void showTimeWithFixedRate() {

        System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now());

}

26


FixedDelay is the time between tasks

The initialDelay is the time after which the task will be executed the first time after the initial delay value

It wait for the completion of previous task

Scheduled Task Using Fixed Delay

@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000, initialDelay = 10000)

public void showTimeWithFixedDelay() {

        System.out.println(LocalDateTime.now());

}

27


The @EnableScheduling annotation is used to enable 
the scheduler for your application. 

This annotation should be added into the main 
Spring Boot application class file.

Enable Scheduling

@SpringBootApplication

@EnableScheduling

public class MyApp {

   public static void main(String[] args) {

      SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args); } }

28


Caching Data


If you using Spring Boot, then simply use the 
spring-boot-starter-cache dependency

Under the hood, the starter brings the 
spring-context-support module




Caching

<dependency>

	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>

	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>

</dependency>

30


When using Spring Boot, the @EnableCaching annotation 
would register the ConcurrentMapCacheManager

No need for separate Bean declaration 

Simply adding the @EnableCaching annotation to any 
of the configuration classes



Enable Caching

@Configuration

@EnableCaching

public class MyConfig {     

	// Some configurations }}

31


Use @Cacheable to demarcate methods that are cacheable

Result is stored in the cache and on subsequent invocations 
(with the same arguments), the value in the cache is returned without having to actually execute the method 

the findAllStudents method is associated with the cache 
named students

@Cacheable

@Cacheable("students")

public List<Student> findAllStudents() { //...  }

32


Custom Cache Resolution





Conditional Caching

@Cacheable (2)

@Cacheable("student", condition = "#avg > 4")

public List<Student> findStudentsByAvgScore(Double avg) { 

//...  

}

@Cacheable("students", cacheManager = "myCacheManager")

public List<Student> findAllStudents() { //...  }

33


When the cache needs to be updated without interfering 
with the method execution

The method is always executed and its result is placed 
into the cache 

It supports the same options as @Cacheable





@CachePut

@CachePut("students")

public List<Student> findAll() { 

	//...   }

34


This process is useful for removing stale or unused 
data from the cache

Using the allEntries attribute to evict all entries from 
the cache  

35

@CacheEvict(cacheNames="books", allEntries=true)

public void loadStudents() { 

	//...  

}

@CacheEvict


To customize the CacheManager we must implement CacheManagerCustomizer<ConcurentMapCacheManager>

Create Bean CacheManager that returns new ConcurentMapChacheManager

36

@Component

public class MyCacheCustomizer implements 	CacheManagerCustomizer<ConcurrentMapCacheManager> {     

	@Override    	

	public void customize(ConcurrentMapCacheManager cacheM){        	  cacheM.setCacheNames(asList("students","courses"));

	}  }

Customize The auto-configured CacheManager
